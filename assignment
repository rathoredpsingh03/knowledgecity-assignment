Senior DevOps Test Task
Scenario:
KnowledgeCity provides a glo
b
ally accessib
le educational platform consisting of the following
components:
1. Front-
End:
A Single Page Application (SPA) b
uilt with React or Svelte, accessib
le through a glo
al
b
marketplace. Users from different regions (e.g., Saudi Ara
bia and the United States) should
have minimal latency when accessing content.
2. Backend Services:
Monolithic PHP Application: The main API handling core
b
usiness logic.
Analytics Microservice (ClickHouse-
b
ased): Analyzes user interaction data
and generates reports.
Video Conversion/Encoding Microservice: Processes uploaded video files,
converting them into optimal formats for glo
b
al delivery.
Additional Microservices: You should consider an architecture that simplifies
adding future microservices as the platform grows.
3. Data Distrib
ution and Multi-Regional Setup:
Client data from Saudi Ara
bia must
b
e stored and served in the Saudi Ara
bia
region.
Client data from the U.S.
must
b
e stored and served in the U.S.
Educational courses created
b
y KnowledgeCity should
b
e glo
b
ally accessib
le,
potentially leveraging regional caching.
The architecture should
b
e multi-regional and multi-availa
bility zone to
achieve high availa
bility (99.99% SLA).
4. Media (Video) Processing and Delivery:
Upload of raw video files.
Automated triggering of the video conversion microservice to produce various
formats and qualities.

Optimal storage strategies (choosing storage classes,
caching) and glo
al
b
video delivery via a CDN.
5. Optimization and Scala
bility:
Automatic scaling of computational resources to handle load spikes.
bility to easily add new regions,
microservices, and data
b
ases as the
b
usiness grows.
Cost optimization through choosing the right storage options,
caching, and
delivery methods.
A
Assignment:
1.
Architectural Design:
Describ
e the architecture considering all services (the monolith, analytics,
video conversion, and potential future microservices), the frontend, and the
data
ases.
b
Show how you would implement multi-regional deployment:
Saudi Ara
bian users’ data resides in the Saudi Ara
bian region.
U.S. users’ data resides in the U.S. region.
Explain how you will ensure multi-availa
bility zone redundancy within each
region to achieve high availa
bility.
Detail how glo
b
al content delivery (including video) will achieve minimal
latency, for example, through CDNs and regionally distrib
uted caches.
Explain how the system will scale as traffic, user counts, and the num
b
er of
microservices/regions grow.
Justify your choice of infrastructural components (cloud providers, CDN,
storage,
data
ases,
b
containerization,
orchestration, etc.
) b
ased on relia
bility,
performance, and cost optimization.
2. Security,
O
b
serva
bility, and Compliance:
Describ
e the security measures: access control,
DDoS protection, WAF usage,
data encryption at rest and in transit, secrets management, and role-
ased
b
access controls.


Explain how monitoring, logging, and tracing will
b
e integrated with security.
Indicate which tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana,
ELK/EFK stack,
OpenTelemetry) you would use, which metrics/logs are critical, and how
o
b
serva
bility supports overall security and compliance goals.
Describ
e how you will detect anomalies,
vulnera
bilities, and ensure
compliance with regional data regulations.
Explain how the architecture can
adapt to evolving regulatory requirements.
Evaluation Criteria:
bility to design a distrib
uted,
multi-regional, and multi-AZ architecture.
Consideration of performance, glo
b
al content delivery, scala
bility, security, and
compliance.
Understanding how o
b
serva
bility (monitoring, logging) ties into the security posture,
ena
b
ling proactive issue detection and resolution.
Maturity in selecting tools and technologies that
b
alance cost, relia
bility, and performance.
